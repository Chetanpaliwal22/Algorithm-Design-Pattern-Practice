	 * Single Pattern is creational pattern. Uses: Mainly used to control the class

	 * 
	 * It is better to use singleton approach instead of creating a globla variable.
	 * Global variable may be copied leading to multiple access points.
	 * 
	 * An example of the use of this pattern will be any legacy system which allows
	 * only single access point and that access point can be given in an effective
	 * way by using this pattern.
